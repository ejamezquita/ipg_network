21	AB	abstract	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades are essential signal transduction components that control a variety of cellular responses in all eukaryotes. MPKs convert extracellular stimuli into cellular responses by the phosphorylation of downstream substrates. Although MPK cascades are predicted to be very complex, only limited numbers of MPK substrates have been identified in plants. Here, we used the kinase client (KiC) assay to identify novel substrates of MPK3 and MPK6. Recombinant MPK3 or MPK6 were tested against a large synthetic peptide library representing in vivo phosphorylation sites, and phosphorylated peptides were identified by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. From this screen, we identified 23 and 21 putative client peptides of MPK3 and MPK6, respectively. To verify the phosphorylation of putative client peptides, we performed in vitro kinase assay with recombinant fusion proteins of isolated client peptides. We found that 13 and 9 recombinant proteins were phosphorylated by MPK3 and MPK6. Among them, 11 proteins were proven to be the novel substrates of two MPKs. This study suggests that the KiC assay is a useful method to identify new substrates of MPKs.
